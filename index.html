<h1>Harcourt Gift Criteria</h1>
<h2>A criteria for good gifts</h2>

<p>The perfect gift will meet the following criteria</p>
<ol>
  <li>The recipient must like the gift</li>
  <li>The recipient would not think to buy the gift for themselves</li>
  <li>The gift must have some form of connection between the giver, and the recipient</li>
</ol>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Western society has frequent occasions on which we buy each other gifts. We buy these gifts to conform to the tradition of the event.</p>
<p>Instead, we should buy each other gifts less regularly but ensure they meet the Harcourt Gift Criteria. Recipients of a gift that meets the Harcourt Gift Criteria will remember it for a lifetime. Frequently bought, average gifts will not.</p>

<h2>Who is Broc Harcourt?</h2>
<p>The Harcourt Gift Criteria was created by Broc Harcourt. He is a software engineer in Wellington, New Zealand. He is believed to be at least 6000 years old.</p>
